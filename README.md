# CustomPagedView

This is a sample app, created for the [Swift Connection 2024](https://swiftconnection.io/) session “Parsing the real intent behind user input”.

The gesture handling is *not* representative of what you'd do in an actual, production app. It's organized that way to neatly isolate each version of the gesture/animation code. Look in the [`PagingDynamics`](/CustomPagedView/PagingDynamics/) folder to see each version: [`SimplestPagingDynamics`](/CustomPagedView/PagingDynamics/SimplestPagingDynamics.swift), [`WithSnappingPagingDynamics`](/CustomPagedView/PagingDynamics/WithSnappingPagingDynamics.swift), and [`VelocityBasedPagingDynamics`](/CustomPagedView/PagingDynamics/VelocityBasedPagingDynamics.swift).
